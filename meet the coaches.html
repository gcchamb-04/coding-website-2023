            Coach Grace has been playing volleyball for two years now. She has played on various teams and in several different tournaments.
            She has played for the Lowcountry Wildcats JV team two years in a row, and will be moving to the varsity level next year. She attempted to 
            play at the YMCA lastyear, but unfortunately had a rather terrible coach. This season, she has two wonderful coaches at the Y 
            and is looking forward to the season. She is also currently playing for the 16U Eagles at Top Flight Volleyball Club, a travel 
            ball team. She has also played at Upwards for two years and will be signing up for the next season in spring. She has also played 
            in several grass tournaments and will continue to play grass as well as indoor. Her favorite position on the court is setter, but 
            she loves outside hitter and libero as well.

          Coach Emma has been playing volleyball for 3 years now. Her first volleyball team was the Lowcountry Wildcats.
          She played on their JV team her first two years and played varsity this last season. She will be returning 
          to play her senior year next season. She has also played rec ball for three years at the YMCA and at Upwards. 
          Unlike Coach Grace, she has had a good experiencewith all of her coaches during the past years at the Y and 
          Upwards. She unfortunately will be unable to play at the Y this season, but plans on joining the Upwards league 
          in the spring. She recently started playing grass last year and has been in a couple tournaments. Her favorite
          position on the court is hitter, right side or outside.
